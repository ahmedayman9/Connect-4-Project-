## This project aims to:
* Create a CONNECT 4 Game that has the functionality of multiplayer CONNECT 4 Game.

* * *

## The Game :

CONNECT 4  is a multiplayer game with two symbols denoting the two players: `X` and `O`. Where you can face off friends (and/or yourself) in a CONNECT 4 battle! ðŸ’ª <br />
The playing board is a `4x4` square. <br /> <br />

* * *

## How to play it :



* * *

## Rules :

* Each player takes a turn placing his character `X or O` into one of the nine squares.
* A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol.
* The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are no empty squares remaining.
* Winning combination is defined as Four horizontally adjacent, Four vertically adjacent, or Four diagonally adjacent symbols.
* If neither player creates a winning combination when all Sixteen squares are occupied, the game is a draw, often referred to as a `cat game`.

* * *
