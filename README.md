## This project aims to:
* Create a CONNECT 4 Game that has the functionality of multiplayer CONNECT 4 Game.

* * *

## The Game :

CONNECT 4  is a multiplayer game with two symbols denoting the two players: `X` and `O`. Where you can face off friends (and/or yourself) in a CONNECT 4 battle! ðŸ’ª <br />
The playing board is a `4x4` square. <br /> <br />

* * *

## How to play it :

1) Open the emulator `Keil
2) Click `Depug`
3) Choose either P1 Vs P2 OR P1 Vs AI.
4) You should put on the switches to select the position.
5) Use tactics to win by filling four adjacent symbols in the grid.


* * *

## Rules :

* Each player takes a turn placing his character `X or O` into one of the nine squares.
* A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol.
* The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are no empty squares remaining.
* Winning combination is defined as Four horizontally adjacent, Four vertically adjacent, or Four diagonally adjacent symbols.
* If neither player creates a winning combination when all Sixteen squares are occupied, the game is a draw, often referred to as a `cat game`.

* * *


## Wining Conditions

### You can win by filling:
